## Session 1

The game starts, the party already having met each other, though not for long. They set up a camp after traveling days toward the town of [[Sandy Point]]. A festival has been told to be taking place there, and the party was interested in taking part. 

The party consists of 
- [[Otulm]], a human inventor with a construct who follows him named [[Case]], 
- [[Velvet]], a human magus, who combines her expert swordsmanship with a magical twist.
- [[Shadowwalker]], a mysterious human who carries assassin tools.
- [[Choata]], a curious being with the body of a man, and the feathers of a bird, called a Stryx. 
- [[Jacko]], a similarly curious being made primarily of vines and leaves with a carved pumpkin for a head, a leshy accompanied by a tangled mass of vines and leaves named [[Erickson]]. 

Suddenly a [[shadowy man]] emerges from the bushes. He strides through camp as if disinterested in the party, he breaks the ground open at the campfire, and grabs an amulet. He speaks a strange bastardized version of common 

>"Nock Va Tisa." 

Time freezes for everyone except the strange man before he suddenly vanishes. the party searched the hole he made and found a seemingly ancient corpse. They find some Mithril threads and some rings.

That night, [[Jacko]] hears footsteps, and a [[strange anime butterfly twink]] emerges from the bushes and begins speaking familiarly with [[Velvet]].  He discloses that the language the [[shadowy man]] said is thousands of years old.


### [[Sandy Point]]

The party arrives at [[Sandy Point]]. There is a noteworthy inn called the [[Rusty Dragon]]. A friendly man in a blue hat approaches and identifies himself as [[Mayor Devorin]]. While [[Otulm]] explores the Cathedral, the rest of the party enters a strange tent with a butterfly symbol as well as the symbol for divination. Inside, they meet [[Zostra]], a fortune teller, who asks the group to take tarot cards to predict their futures, collectively and individually. 

Soon after, the party hears screaming and dogs yelping, followed by loud drumming. they exit the tent to see the festival being overrun by goblins. The party narrowly defeats the goblins before being approached by the [[Balor Hemlock]] who asks us to help him defend the North Gate.
