## North Gate

As directed, the team moves to the North Gate. They come to find a guard house on fire and hear a distinct voice yelling "help!"

They encounter multiple goblinoids and some weird looking dog-like creatures and handily manage to defeat them with the help of the well-dressed [[Alderin Foxglove]] who managed to cleave a few goblins single-handedly after being provided a makeshift axe from [[Choata]].

Shortly after, [[Jacko]] finds a note written in Goblin and starts to act suspiciously. Being chased by [[Velvet]], he throws some ball bearings to help him hide. Nearby he finds a small box with a magical necklace.

The [[Mayor Devorin|mayor]] quickly approaches [[Alderin Foxglove|Foxglove]] and announces how happy he is that he survived, quickly adding that the party should meet him in his office later to receive payment as thanks. 

[[Miko]], operator of the [[Rusty Dragon]] offers the party free room and board as thanks for our efforts in saving the town, and they quickly accept. Meanwhile [[Choata]] seeks aid at [[Sandy Point Cathedral|the cathedral]] , where a priest nearly kills him by botching his surgery.

## Mayor's Office 

The party attempts to meet at the Mayor's office, but [[Balor Hemlock|The Sherriff]]
informed them that he was not available and gave them a job. He believes that the attack was a diversion and there was some strange activity in the graveyard. He asked us to meet him in the graveyard at evening. He also mentions that it might be worth talking to [[Abstelar Zanthis|Abstelar]] 

## Cathedral 

With some free time available to them, the party enters [[Sandy Point Cathedral|the cathedral]] which is much less crowded and notably untouched from the attack.

The party inquires about [[Abstelar Zanthis|Abstelar]]

BARRELMANCY IS OUTLAWED (REAL CANON)

Eventually [[Abstelar Zanthis|the high priest]] enters the room. We inform him about the weird [[shadowy man]]. He informs us that "Nock Va Tisa" is Old Thasalonian for "Not Enough Time."

He retells the story of how [[Thasalon]] fell, which was news to [[Jacko]] who appeared to be a little more somber at the description of the [[Skyfall]]. 

[[Abstelar Zanthis|Abstelar]] agrees to meet the party at the graveyard, finding the description of events to be curious.

## Mayors Office (Again) 

The party returns to the mayor's office where he rewards them with 50gp each. [[Mayor Devorin|The mayor]] informs the group that he had his guards check after the fight and he's confident that the goblin invaders came from a goblin camp up the mountain. It had been quiet for a while until the attack. His guards determined that the goblins were under the command of a human. [[Alderin Foxglove|Foxglove]] will have a report when we return. 

He gave the party instructions to clear out the goblin camp and rendezvous with [[Scout Hasille]]. [[Mayor Devorin|The Mayor]] says the party can keep all plunder from the camp in addition to the 500gp reward. There is no time limit, but sooner is better.

## Graveyard 

The party enters the graveyard and find [[Abstelar Zanthis|The High Priest]] and [[Balor Hemlock|Sheriff]]talking.
