[[Sandy Point]]
Fairly large. Has a foyer where people can wipe their feet, followed by the large room where ceremonies are held. At the front of this room is multiple movable altars dedicated for public worship of the main 7 good deities, though [[Kade Kaelin]] prefers to be thought about more at taverns and similar structures meant for travelers.

There are side rooms for medical assistance and other purposes. 

In the center of the main room are trees specifically placed to allow the colors to be rather beautiful if even hypnotic.
